<p>
  Next Auth is an application that was developed with the best back-end practices approaches when it comes about authentication, authorization, generating tokens, refresh tokens, designated a user to a specific route, page or website. This is a approache to handle with log in, sign in, sign out and the most errors that could happen when a user interact with a website and cookies.
  
  In this application was used the cookies to save the token and refresh token data to store the user informations. The jwt token was used in this development as a way to handle with the user email, roles and permissions, this roles and permissions was necessary to handle with the user access to specific pages, also to redirect the user if not exists a token, permission or a role approved.
  
  Both client side and server side (the Next method Get Server Side Props) were used to handle with all the user events that could happen based on the user token that contains his information.
  
  You can use this template to developer your application and connecting to a database or API to consume the data.
